# Architecture decision records

A record of decisions that diverge from `/docs`, add something the specs did not
sanction, or leave a question deliberately open. The specs stay the source of
truth; these files say where the code does not match them and why.

## When an ADR is required

CLAUDE.md names five triggers. If any applies, the PR does not land without one.

1. **A spec is ambiguous.** "When a spec is ambiguous, choose the simplest
   option consistent with docs/02-architecture.md and record the decision in
   docs/decisions/ADR-NNNN.md" (CLAUDE.md:4-6).
2. **A new AI surface.** "New AI surfaces must map to a pattern in docs/15 §4 or
   add one via ADR" (CLAUDE.md §11).
3. **A seam is removed or bypassed.** "Removing or bypassing a documented seam
   requires an ADR" (CLAUDE.md §15).
4. **A third-party service beyond the approved list.** "Do not add third-party
   services beyond the approved list in docs/02 §9 without an ADR"
   (CLAUDE.md, Guardrails).
5. **Novelty.** "Prefer boring technology; novelty needs an ADR"
   (CLAUDE.md, Guardrails).

An ADR is also the right place for a decision that is genuinely the product
owner's to make. Record the options and the trade-offs, mark the status `open`,
and do not pick.

## Numbering and format

- `ADR-NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, zero-padded to four digits, allocated
  sequentially. Numbers are never reused, even if an ADR is superseded.
- Front matter: `Status`, `Date`, `Context` (the spec sections and CLAUDE.md
  clauses it touches), then `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`.
- Statuses: `accepted`, `open` (the decision is not made), `superseded by
  ADR-NNNN`, `rejected`. Never delete an ADR — supersede it.
- Every factual claim about the code carries a `path:line` reference.
- Consequences include the negative ones. An ADR that only lists benefits is
  marketing, not a record.
- Compliance claims come from docs/12 only (CLAUDE.md, Guardrails). Quote it or
  say nothing.

## Spec edits these ADRs imply

Several ADRs record that a spec is now wrong. Per CLAUDE.md's definition of done
("Docs touched if behaviour diverges from /docs — spec-first, code follows"),
these edits are outstanding:

- docs/07 §3 — labelled rail, not icon-collapsible (ADR-0011); flat URL scheme,
  not `/m/{module}/{area}/{id}` (ADR-0003); `/` is a dashboard, not a per-role
  landing redirect (ADR-0005).
- docs/07 §2 — `ChartFrame`/echarts is not built (ADR-0009).
- CLAUDE.md:12, README.md:44, docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md:90 and :769-771 — React
  Router 8, not v7 (ADR-0004).
- CLAUDE.md:23-25 and :40, docs/11 §1, docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md:94 and :122,
  `.github/workflows/security.yml:95` — `ops/`, not `infra/onprem/`
  (ADR-0010).
